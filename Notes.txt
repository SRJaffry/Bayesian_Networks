1. I first understood the article from the PhD guy from Zurich in which he used statistics to show the relationship between the variables. But he relied on the DAG. Hence, I stumbled upon my question again. How to draw the DAG in first place from the given data.

2. This brings me to following article:

3. What I tried in article read in (2) is that structural learning was unable to find any edges between the nodes. So the next thing I will try in the morning is the parametric learning.

4. In parametric learning, the domain expert will use the knowledge to draw the graphs with nodes and edges. I left here and will pick up from here.
